      Mr Akanbi is planning to visit his village this December.
      He is concerned about how to manage the SHARING OF HIS money among his kinsmen so he decided to contact his son who is a software developer at the Bulb Africa to help him with a program that will help him to sort that out. 
      He is to write a function that will take two arguments; First argument is the total amount he will spend, second argument is the age of his kinsmen present in an array. 
      
      conditions:
      so for people whose age is between 0 - 20 they should have 20% of the
      total money while for people within the range of 21 - 45 they will have a
      share of 30%; and for people whose age is between is between 46 - 65 they
      will have a share of 45%; and for people whose age is above 65 thy will
      have a share of 50%; The program should return an array that will contain
      the amount each kinsmen have. 

      the output should return an array with the amount of each kinsmen get in an array form <div class="">

      MoneyFormula(40000,[30,56,79]) => output [x,y,z]
